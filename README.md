# causal_inference
This project focuses on implementing techniques used to perform causal inference to the Wisconsin cancer dataset.

The project begins with exploring the observed data, to derive the relationships that can seen from the data collected. 
The correlation matrix is plotted to identify the bivariate relationship between the variables.

The relationships under causal inference are also explore by using python libraries to plot directed acrylic graphs(DAGs).
The variable that directly cause the outcome variable as seen from the causal graph are retained in the dataset for training and
prediction.
